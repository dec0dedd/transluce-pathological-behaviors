class SimpleFuture[T]:
    """A simple anyio-based future.

    Futures can hold a single result, which is provided by an async task. Following anyio (rather
    than asyncio) conventions, every task is associated with a task group. Futures allow us to
    more easily pass around "boxes" that will eventually contain results.

    Note that if you just want to wait for a set of tasks to complete, you can just use an anyio
    task group, and store the result in a mutable container like a list or dict; you don't need
    futures the same way you do in asyncio. This class is most useful when either:
    - you only have a single result of each type and don't want to deal with creating a list with
      one element, or want the more convenient typechecked interface of SimpleFuture,
    - you want to pass a box between two tasks, so that one task can set the result and another
      can wait for it to be set, without requiring a more heavyweight mechanism like a queue.

    A basic low-level pattern you can use to run a task and get its result later:

    ```python
    async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:
        future = SimpleFuture()

        async def go(*args):
            future.set_result(await some_task_fn(*args))

        tg.start_soon(go, *args)

        # do something else asynchronously while the task runs

    # once you exit the task group, the future will have a result
    value = future.get()
    ```

    This pattern is useful enough that there is a wrapper so that you can instead do:

    ```python
    async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:
        future = future_from_start_soon(tg, some_task_fn, *args)
        # do something else asynchronously while the task runs

    # once you exit the task group, the future will have a result
    value = future.get()
    ```

    You can also use `await future.wait_for_result()` to wait for the future to complete and get
    the result.
